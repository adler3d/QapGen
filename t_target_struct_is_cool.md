### Self-Describing Grammar — The Key Feature

```cpp
t_target_struct:i_target_item{
  t_keyword{string kw=any_str_from_vec(split("struct,class",","));" "?}
  t_body_semicolon:i_struct_impl{";"}
  t_body_impl:i_struct_impl{
    "{"  // This brace corresponds to the opening brace in the declaration line "t_target_struct:i_target_item{"
    vector<TAutoPtr<i_target_item>> nested?;
    " "?
    vector<TAutoPtr<i_struct_field>> arr?;
    " "?
    TAutoPtr<t_struct_cmds> cmds?;
    " "?
    TAutoPtr<t_cpp_code> c?;
    " "?
    "}"  // This closing brace corresponds to the closing brace of the structure body
  }
  t_parent{
    string arrow_or_colon=any_str_from_vec(split("=>,:",","));
    " "?
    t_name parent;
  }
  TAutoPtr<t_keyword> kw?;
  t_name name;
  " "?
  TAutoPtr<t_parent> parent?;
  " "?
  TAutoPtr<i_struct_impl> body;
}
```

- In this example, the very beginning of the structure description is **not just the keyword** `struct` or `class`, but the **mandatory field** `t_name name;` which defines the name of the structure.
- This means that the grammar describes **not only the syntax of the language but also itself** — this lexer is capable of reading and understanding its own description.
- The curly braces `"{"` and `"}"` in `t_body_impl` are **not merely syntactic symbols**, but part of a mechanism that allows the grammar to recursively extend itself, including nested definitions.
- This approach enables building **flexible, extensible, and self-documenting parsers** that can adapt and evolve along with the language.


### Why This Is Cool and Important

- Self-describing parsers are rare and complex. Most classical parsers require external grammar descriptions that are not integrated with the parser itself.
- In contrast, QapDSLv2 is good because it uses a self-describing approach to build its own parser/lexers_tree, which helps it independently analyze and modify its own structure, opening up new horizons for automation and code generation.
- Such a design significantly simplifies the maintenance and development of complex languages with rich and evolving grammars.


### Summary

- The self-describing nature is the **heart and soul** of QapGen, and it is precisely what makes this project unique and powerful.
- The curly braces are a crucial element of this mechanism, providing structure and nesting.
- The mandatory field `t_name name;` is the starting point from which all the magic of self-description begins.
